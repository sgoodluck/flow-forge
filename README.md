# Initial README.MD

## Running Thoughts

- **2024-10-24 11:20** This looks like a fun take home project. Finally wrapped up some consulting work, so will be starting in on this project now.
- **2024-10-24 12:28** Alright, got my nvim editor setup (new linux computer, took a minute!) and have read through a good portion of the docs for React Flow. I'll be able to handle all of the requirements using the library. It is a very comprehensive library indeed. I also sketched some designs I'll go for. Time to start coding
- **2024-10-24 18:26** A lot of interrupts today from client work. Made good progress in the pockets I could. Just need to add interactivity and labels. Might add some extras later on too for kicks. I'm approaching 4 hours at this point I think
